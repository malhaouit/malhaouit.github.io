        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
            Inspired by the transformative education model of <strong>ALX</strong>, an online school dedicated to empowering African youth with cutting-edge tech skills, <strong>Events Founder</strong> emerged as a practical tool to enhance community interaction. Our platform not only simplifies event management but also fosters a sense of community among ALX students and alumni, encouraging continuous learning and networking.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is a culmination of our experiences as software engineering students at ALX, reflecting our passion for technology and our commitment to solving real-world problems.
